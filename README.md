# CSCI-4448---Object-Oriented-Design
OOD Projects w/ Jason Nguyen &amp; Varunjit Srinivas

Project Title: Homework 2 - Car Garage

The assignment was fun and was a really nice way to get our toes wet with Java development. 

Hurdles mainly involved trying to understand the tasks the assignment wanted us to complete, and then 
figuring out the best way to achieve that task using good object oriented design principles.

This often took a good chunk of time just thinking rather than just blindly coding (which I am very guilty of).
I realized that taking this approach probably saves way more time in the long run and makes code generally more concise / organized.

Object Oriented Design principles were used all over the place, so much that it was often times hard to track. 
Often times multiple design principles are used together. 
I now understand why Java is used to teach this class. The language is structured around Object Oriented Design Principles.

Had a lot of fun!
