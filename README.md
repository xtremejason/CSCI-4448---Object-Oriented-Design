The assignment was fun and was a really nice way to get our toes wet with Java development. 

Hurdles mainly involved trying to understand the tasks the assignment wanted us to complete, and then 
figuring out the best way to achieve that task using good object oriented design principles.

This often took a good chunk of time just thinking rather than just blindly coding (which I am very guilty of).
I realized that taking this approach probably saves way more time in the long run and makes code generally more concise / organized.

Object Oriented Design principles were used all over the place, so much that it was often times hard to track. 
Often times multiple design principles are used together. 
I now understand why Java is used to teach this class. The language is structured around Object Oriented Design Principles.

Had a lot of fun! <br />

Team Members: Jason Nguyen, Varunjit Srinivas, Isaac Sim** <br />

**Software Used:**  <br />
**IntelliJ Community: ver. 2021.1.2** <br />
**JUnit ver 5.7.2 ** <br />

We were all eager to code the Design Patterns that we have recently learned. We were pretty confident in our ability given the elaborate examples of the design patterns we learned in class and in our reading materials. We decided early on to delegate the work evenly, and to each make clones of the master branch so that we can work on our separate implementations individually. <br />


Issues Experienced: 
-The schedules of our group were all over the place. Zoom meetings weren't feasible this week so we communicated on our progress throughout the week via phone messaging.
-Had to spend several hours trying to figure out why Isaac's branch could not be merged/rebased onto the master branch. After trying for a solution to no avail, I had to resort to  copy/pasting/rewriting the code manually into the master branch. (Problem believed to be not cloning the master branch properly.)
-JUnit Testing was a pain to learn as resources were scarcely available.

Conclusion: 
We all have a better grasp on the design patterns that were covered throughout the previous weeks of class. Learning it in class is one thing, actually coding it gave us a whole new way of conceptualizing the Factory Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Observer Pattern, and the Observable.
